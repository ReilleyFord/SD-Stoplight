# SDLocker-2.1
A custom firmware for SDLocker 2 (Atmega328p) device


This project is an extension of the SDLocker 2 firmware that makes it possible
to unlock SD cards protected by an unknown (or forgotten) password.
Additionally, the UART library missing from the original sources was reconstructed.
Code::Blocks IDE project files included.


Example of use:
The genuine multimedia system of many Mitsubishi vehicles contains navigation
maps on a SD card. It's possible to update those maps by inserting SD containing
newer maps. But after that the SD card is locked (password protected)
and not accessible by any other SD-compliant device. The password is not known.
This firmware extends the original SDLocker 2 with a feature to reset the password.

BE AWARE THAT IN RESULT ALL CONTENTS OF SD IS ERASED DUE TO SECURITY REASONS


How to use:
- read about the original device by the link below.
- flash the firmware
- insert a locked SD and turn power on
- press PWD for at least 10 seconds to ERASE SD and RESET THE PASSWORD
- create partition on the SD
